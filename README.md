# Fan Academy Back-end

Fan Academy is a fan-made revival of the game **Hero Academy**, a turn-based tactics game developed by Robot Entertainment. This project aims to bring back the joy of the original game, offering a way for fans to rediscover it.

This repository hosts the server code of the project. For the game logic (and a full README), visit the [client-side repo](https://github.com/Dan-DH/fan-academy).
